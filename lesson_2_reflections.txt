What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	
	A new sub-directory ".git" gets created within the working directory.
	".git" contains metadata about the history of the files in the repository.
	This means all the files within this working directory are now being tracked by Git.
	I need to do this in order to start tracking the history of the 
	files with Git and be able to add commits. 
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The working directory is the directory where we have our files in our computer.
	These are the files that we normally work on and make changes to.
	
	The repository is where we have all of our commits, and it contains all the
	history of the files in it.
	
	The staging area is an intermediate layer between the working directory and
	the repository. It allows us to choose what files will be sent to the repository
	when we perform our next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
