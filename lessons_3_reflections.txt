When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	
	Whenever I am working on a project with a team. This allows the team to have a centralized version of the project which will contain the latest changes made by the members. And all of them can access the latest state of the repo at any time.
	Also, for security reasons, your projects are safer on GitHub servers than only on your local computer.
